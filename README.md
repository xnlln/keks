🌸 The Magical Lily Bouquet
Welcome to a digital, interactive Valentine’s experience. This isn't just a webpage; it’s a multi-stage journey—starting with a vintage letter, moving through a playful quiz, and ending with a hand-coded, blooming garden of glowing lilies.

I built this to be a romantic gesture that feels alive, using a mix of physics, art, and a little bit of "No"-button-dodging mischief.

✨ What’s Inside?
The Envelope: A vintage splash screen that kicks things off with ambient music.

The Flower Pop: When the letter opens, physics-based lilies (powered by Matter.js) explode across the screen.

The "Impossible" Quiz: A series of sweet questions leading to the big "Will you be my Valentine?" moment. (Fair warning: the "No" button is very good at running away!)

The Grand Finale: A custom-coded Canvas animation where three pink lilies grow and bloom in real-time, surrounded by fireflies and swaying grass.

🛠️ How it Works
I kept this lightweight so it’s easy to run and share. No heavy frameworks or complicated installs needed.

The Canvas Engine: I used Vanilla JS and HTML5 Canvas to procedurally "grow" the lilies—so the animation feels organic every time.

The Physics: Matter.js handles the gravity and collision for the floating flowers.

The Look: A mix of Glassmorphism (that frosted glass look) and romantic typography (Great Vibes).

🚀 How to Run It
Download the files (or clone the repo).

Open index.html in any modern browser.

Pro Tip: If you're using VS Code, use the Live Server extension. It helps the background music play more reliably!

❤️ Make it Yours
Want to use this for your own person? Open up script.js and you can easily swap out the quiz questions or the final message to make it a personalized surprise.
